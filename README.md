# OOP Principles project in C++

## Description
This project is a demonstration of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C++. It covers all four main principles of OOP: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.

## OOP Concepts Demonstrated
1. **Encapsulation**: The class `Company` uses private and protected access specifiers to control the access to employee data and restrict it.
2. **Inheritance**: The class `rest_time` inherits from the `Company` class to add more functionality.
3. **Polymorphism**: Virtual functions like `Work()` and `restInWorkTime()` demonstrate method overriding in derived classes.
4. **Abstraction**: The `Work_Type` class acts as an abstract base class with a pure virtual function, providing a framework for derived classes to implement.
